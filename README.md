# Model Based Reinforcement Learning Re-implementations for [Unstable Baselines](https://github.com/x35f/unstable_Baselines)

## Stable Algorithms (Runnable and has equivalent performance to that of the original implementations)
* [When to Trust Your Model: Model-Based Policy Optimization](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/9416-when-to-trust-your-model-model-based-policy-optimization.pdf) (MBPO)

## Results
* The Tensorboard logs of some experimental runs has been included in the ``results`` directory.
* Test Machine Information
	* Ubuntu 20.04
	* Intel I9-12900KF
	* NVIDIA RTX 3080
	* Crucial DDR5 96 GigaBytes
